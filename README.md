The data comprises a time-series of frames from camera-captured video, showing fish feeding before (2 minutes) and after (8 minutes) the feeder opens. These frames are sequential and crucial for analyzing feeding behavior. We used CNN-TCN models to label feeding states (0 for not feeding, 1 for feeding). Frames before the feeder opens are labeled 0, while those in the first 2 minutes after it opens are labeled 1. We trained deep learning models using the first 4 minutes to control the feeder afterward. Code is provided for frame extraction and generating 15 datasets for training and validation.
