The dataset comprises video frames of fish feeding, spanning two minutes before to eight minutes after feeder activation. Frames before feeding are labeled 0, and the first two minutes after as 1. CNN-TCN models trained on the initial four minutes capture spatialâ€“temporal patterns for real-time feeding control.
